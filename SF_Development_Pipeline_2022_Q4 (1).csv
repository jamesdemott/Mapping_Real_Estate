To provide this new space, the school will demolish a portion of the north end of the campus and replace it with an addition to the existing main academic building. The area to be demolished includes a chapel, dining hall with kitchen, administrative offices, a 34-room dormitory with eight occupants, and a garage. The addition includes three stories above a basement, the height of which will match that of the existing main academic building.

The project includes a new main entrance at the connection between the existing main academic building and the proposed addition. The connection will occur at all three levels of the building to facilitate circulation between the new and existing areas.

The project will eliminate the 13 exterior parking spaces used by the school along the northern property line as well as eight garage spaces dedicated for the exclusive use of the eight Jesuits living in the dorm rooms. There will still be 86 existing parking spaces at the south end of the campus that will remain. The project will provide 150 new bike parking spaces (120 Class I and 30 Class II spaces). The existing vehicular access and service drive will remain and will continue to provide access to the west side of the campus. The driveway will, however, be moved approximately 3’ to the south. The existing loading area will remain at the north end of the campus. The trash and recycling area will be moved to the inside of the building.

The project will require a Conditional Use Authorization for the following: (1) to allow a school use within the RH-1 Zoning District, (2) to amend an existing Planned Unit Development with a rear yard modification, and (3) for the removal of dwelling units (the 34 dorm rooms) per the criteria provided in Planning Code Section 317(g)(6).",,436640,114698,,436640,128398,,,,,0,-13700,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,false,false,,15 - Outer Sunset,4,Outer Parkside,Sunset/Parkside,RH-1,40-X,0,0,0,-122.496293843,37.7473315472,2022,Q4,2022_Q4,POINT (-122.496293843 37.7473315472),39,10,7,35,

The proposed storefronts will be built within the existing historic openings. No original fabric will be removed and the historic character of the building will be retained. The proposed storefront design will have full-height glass with vertical steel mullions that are rhythmically spaced. The storefront will also have a horizontal steel mullion at the location of a transom line and another horizontal steel mullion at the lower portion of the storefront. The panels below the lower horizontal mullion are proposed to be steel and will have the appearance of a bulkhead. The storefront will rest on the existing concrete base which is low in height.  The entry door to the restaurant seating area will be located at the second bay from the east end and will be a framed door with a glazed panel. This portion of the storefront (7’-6” in length) will be set back to prevent the door from crossing the property line as it swings out. The third bay from the eastern end of the building will have an entry door to the restaurant’s kitchen. This door will be a solid metal door with a painted metal surround. The storefront glazing in this bay will be back-painted approximately halfway up the storefront to hide back of house storage.

The proposed storefront will be compatible with the District through the use of painted steel, a material found throughout the Jackson Square Historic District. The new storefront design will also be compatible with its reference to both a bulkhead and transom line. The storefront mullions convey verticality, a characteristic that is compatible with typical punched windows in contributing buildings in the District.",,18970,49,,,0,,,0,,8156,0,,,0,,10814,49,,,0,,,,CENCHILL,Gary Bell +  Associates,,4153770425,,false,false,,3 - Northeast,3,Finiancial District North,North Beach,C-2,65-A,Downtown/Van Ness/Northeast Neighborhoods,Jackson Square,0,-122.403380758,37.7975073366,2022,Q4,2022_Q4,POINT (-122.403380758 37.7975073366),106,6,3,23,

The proposed project would demolish the two existing two-story commercial buildings, currently an Everything $1.50 or Less store at 4550 Mission Street and a vacant commercial space at 4570 Mission Street, previously occupied by a Payless Shoe Source, and would construct a new mixed-use residential and commercial building. 

The proposed building would include 69 dwelling units, consisting of 36 one-bedroom units, 23 two-bedroom units, and 10 three-bedroom units. The proposed building would be six stories tall and 64 feet in height to the roof (as measured from Mission Street, and approximately 79 feet in height to the top of the elevator penthouse) and would contain approximately 74,410 gross square feet. The building would contain 3,690 square feet of ground-level commercial space. Open space would be provided in private patios on the ground-level, and a common deck with an adjacent stormwater garden. Common open space decks would also be provided on the 6th floor and roof, along with solar panels. 

The project would utilize the HOME-SF program to increase the building height from 40 feet to 55 feet for the 4570 Mission Street parcel, and from 56 feet to 64 feet for the 4550 Mission Street parcel. The proposed project would add a curb cut along Harrington Street for an entrance to a ramp for a basement parking garage. The garage would contain a total of 31 vehicle parking spaces (including two ADA spaces) and 86 Class I bicycle parking spaces. Two Class II bicycle parking spaces would be provided along the Mission Street frontage. The sidewalk along Harrington Street would be expanded from approximately eight feet to 14 feet. 

The proposed construction would require excavation over an approximately 12,510 square foot area to an average depth of 15 feet for a total excavation of approximately 6,950 cubic yards of soil. A total of 10 new trees would be planted, five along Mission Street, and five along Harrington Street.

The proposed project at 313 Burnett Avenue would provide 25,803 square feet of residential space with five two-bedroom units and four three-bedroom units including 2,343 square feet of private deck and patio space, and 555 square feet of common open space on a shared roof deck.

Each building would provide eight on-site vehicular parking spaces including one accessible parking space (16 spaces total) in multi-level car stackers (one in each garage), and 36 Class 1 bicycle parking spaces (18 in each building) both accessed via proposed garage or building entrances on Burnett Avenue. The project would create two approximate 10-foot-wide curb cuts for access to each of the proposed garages, and install six new street trees, four Class 2 bicycle parking spaces (two in front of each building), and new sidewalk, curb, and gutter along the new building frontages on Burnett Avenue. The project would also add two accessible curb ramps located on either side of the street intersection of Burnett Avenue and Burnett Avenue North. The project would remove one significant tree from the 313 Burnett Avenue property and three trees from the 333 Burnett Avenue property.
Excavation of a total of approximately 12,176 cubic yards of material (for both lots) to a depth of about 44 feet would be required to construct the two new residential buildings.
